# BrainTumor_3DAuto_Segmentation_U_Net_Model_MRI
We will build a neural network to automatically segment tumor regions in brain, using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans.

The MRI scan is one of the most common image modalities that we encounter in the radiology field.
Other data modalities include:

Computer Tomography (CT),
Ultrasound
X-Rays.
In this project we will be focusing on MRIs but many of our techniques can be applied to other mentioned modalities as well. We'll walk through some of the steps of training a deep learning model for segmentation.
